# Concurrent-Printer
This is a printer sharing application using java concurrent.

Several students share a printer to print documents. One technician refills the paper when it has run out and one technician replaces the toner cartridge when it runs out


The Java implementation of the system consists of:

 a shared printer,

 four students who share it and  two technicians who service it.

The students each use the printer to print several documents
Each technician only does one job, i.e. one only refills the paper tray & the other only replaces the toner cartridge.
